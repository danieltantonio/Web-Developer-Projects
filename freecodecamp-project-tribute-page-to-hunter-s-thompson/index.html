      <li><b>1972:</b> During a job to write about a dirtbike competition in Las Vegas. Thompson was using that time to write about "The American Dream". This book would be called <i>Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas</i>, a drug filled, countercultural book about Hunter's adventure in Las Vegas.

It would later become a mainstream success, and eventually turn into a movie.</li>
      <li><b>1981:</b> Hunter divorced Sandra.</li>
      <li><b>Later Years:</b> After his success with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, he became more like his rebelious persona in his books. He eventually wrote more "Fear and Loathing" books about different subjects and places, but each book was almost similar to the ones before and thus became a bit repetitive. He would travel to different places like Hawaii, and work multiple jobs, and eventually settled back to writing about sports. He would also marry a new woman named Anita Bejmuk.</li>
      <li><b>Feb 2005:</b> Hunter was back at home in Colorado with now grown son. Feeling depressed and washed up, he put a bullet into his gun, and called his wife. He put the gun up to his head and asked Anita to come home to help him with a new ESPN article. As soon as he hung up he fired the gun. They would then find a piece of paper in his typewriter that only says: "counselor". Johnny Depp (a close friend to Thompson) held a $3 Million funeral for him.</li>
